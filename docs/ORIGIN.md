# Upstream Reference

This project started from the public repository [`Diana-hub23/practica10-ansible`](https://github.com/Diana-hub23/practica10-ansible).

Artifacts inherited:
- Container scaffolding (`docker/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).
- Base Ansible inventory (`inventory.ini`) and playbooks (`setup.yml`, `ansible/setup.yml`).
- Documentation excerpt in `README.md`.

All new work in this repository will re-implement the automation logic with an original structure, keeping only the high-level idea (provisioning two Apache web servers with Ansible).
